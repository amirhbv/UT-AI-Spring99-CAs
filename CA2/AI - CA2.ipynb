    "Chromosomes are made of genes. Each individual chromosome is a member of our seach space. As we are going to find the key for Substitution Cipher our chromosomes are keys and are made of english alphabets. So our genes are characters and each chromosome is representing a mapping of lowercase alphabets to the corresponding letter in the cipher text.\n",
