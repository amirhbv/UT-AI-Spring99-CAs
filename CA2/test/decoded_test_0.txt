My argument is based on quite usual theistic assumptions, namely godis perfect, god is all-knowing god sets the rules.

 Of course, you may not actually be a    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks: * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.

 This strongly suggests    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they    are aware of this fatal deficiency.
When you say (paraphrased)#in (2) that this is not "evidence for [benefactor]", for example, what you#mean is that it's no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].Yes, that's what I mean.#In (3), however, you've shifted the meaning of "evidence for [benefactor]"#so that it now means `absolute' "evidence for [benefactor]" rather than#`relative' "evidence for [benefactor]" w.r.t.
You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his    statement.

 Objective values are those which must fall into one or other ofthose options for all people - or, if you are prepared for dissent, thenthey are those values which should be accepted by everyone.If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'.Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad, or atleast right versus wrong (or even just correct versus incorrect) anda way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour.In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort.Suppose you could predict with almost 100% accuracy that Americansbelieved that something is better than nothing.You could usefully say that the existence of that value was anobjective fact.

 Not manyalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yetpeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there areside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it'scode?The next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, thematerialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind ofchemical reaction.

 This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am ratherdubious of a lot of the source theories.There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT isobscure and presumably corrupted.

"no weight whatsoever" is the lowest form or
reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort
of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,
wrong, and the Bible.
